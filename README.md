# Address-Picker (Google Maps) ![APEX Plugin](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Dani3lSun/apex-github-badges/b7e95341/badges/apex-plugin-badge.svg)

> NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT - all features of this plugin have now been rolled into the **[JK64 Report Map](https://jeffreykemp.github.io/jk64-plugin-reportmap/)** - please use that one instead.

**A Region plugin for Oracle Application Express**

This allows you to add a Google Map region to any page, showing a heatmap based on a query you specify.

## DEMO ##

[https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=JK64_GEOHEATMAP&c=JK64](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=JK64_GEOHEATMAP&c=JK64)

## PRE-REQUISITES ##

* [Oracle Application Express 5.0.2](https://apex.oracle.com)
* You need a [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#get-an-api-key)

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ##

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jeffreykemp/jk64-plugin-heatmap/releases/latest)
2. Install the plugin to your application - **region_type_plugin_com_jk64_heatmap.sql**
3. Supply your **Google API Key** (Component Settings)
4. Add a region to the page, select type **GeoHeatmap [Plug-In]**
5. For **SQL Source**, enter a query with 3 columns (see example below)
6. Update the **Number of Rows** to a reasonable upper limit (default is 15, you probably want a much bigger number)

**Sample query**

```sql
select lat, lng, weight from mydata
```

If you don't have any "weight" to go with the data points (e.g. population, earthquake magnitude, sales volume), just set the third column to `1`, e.g. `select lat, lng, 1 from mydata`.
